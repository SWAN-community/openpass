# OpenPass

As users look for more transparency and ownership of their personal data, many existing identity technologies that enable 1:1 personalized advertising are being phased out.

The OpenPass proposal aims to answer the privacy and transparency needs of consumers, while ensuring publishers and advertisers (collectively media owners) can continue to provide impactful addressable advertising experiences and fund the open internet.

OpenPass is an open-source ID framework solution, designed for scaled adoption across the whole AdTech industry ecosystem. This solution supports several ID libraries (starting with Unified ID 2.0). OpenPass provides a consistent and unified way to manage advertising user consent and privacy settings inside a website and across a network of websites (no matter the technical identity behind). Through this consistency and transparency, OpenPass contributes to regaining consumers’ trust and so contributing to preserve advertisers and publishers’ interests.

With a focus on full customer-centricity, OpenPass SSO facilitates reaching any consented user with the best personalized ad experience for that user.  Advertisers and publishers can leverage any OpenPass-supported ID to capture both authenticated and unauthenticated traffic. This helps advertisers and publishers deliver relevant experiences to both types of consumers, by sharing these IDs with their adtech partners.

OpenPass SSO also strives for providing the best user experience possible, by not requiring users to reenter their credentials every time they browse a new website that is part of the OpenPass network.
